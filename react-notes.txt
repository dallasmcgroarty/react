React is like a wrapper for html. It displays html to users and changes html when the user does something.

Create functions that return JSX which tells React what to display.

React components:
    - functions that return JSX
    - many components within a react App

App.js:
    - coordinate components within the app

How does react start up:
    - JS files bundled into one file (App bundle)
    - User makes request to server and gets an html file + the JS bundle
    - Browser executes code
    - index.js file executes first and grabs the root element
    - render within that root element and get the App component

Use state functions:
    - function that works with React's state system
    - state is like a variable in React
    - state is used to store data that changes over time
    - whenever state changes, React automatically updates content on the screen

Start up App:
    - go into project folder
    - run 'npm start' in terminal (start dev environment)
    - open browser and go to localhost:3000
    - press 'control+c' in terminal to stop project

React app dev server:
    - Babel - turns JSX into normal JS code
    - Webpack - merges all files into a single file

Folders/files:
    node_modules - folder with all the dependencies required to run our project
    package-lock.json, package.json - lists the dependencies our project needs to work correctly
    index.js - first file that gets executed when our app runs
    index.html - skeleton for the React app

Reference JS variable or expression:
    - in JSX wrap variable/expression in {}

JSX props:
    - props can refer to a variable using the same curly braces syntax
    - props don't have to be defined as variables
    - arrays - wrap with curly braces
    - objects - wrap with curly braces (cant display with JSX but can pass as a prop)
    - variables - wrap with curly braces

HTML to JSX:
    - names/values of attributes that you provide to elements in HTML are slightly different in JSX
    - 1. all prop names follow camelCase
    - 2. number attributes use curly braces
    - 3. Boolean 'true' can be writting with just the property name. 'False' should be written with curly braces
    - 4. the 'class' attribute is written as 'className'
    - 5. In-line styles are provided as objects

Creating a Component:
    - 1. create new file, start with capital letter
    - 2. make component. should be a function that returns JSX
    - 3. Export the component at the bottom of the file
    - 4. Import the component into another file
    - 5. Use the component

Component Heirarchy:
    - relationaship between components
    - parent to children
    - children to siblings

Props System:
    - pass data from a parent to child
    - allows a parent to configure each child differently
    - one way flow of data, child can't push props back
    - 25% of understanding how react works

    Communicaton with props:
        - add attributes to a JSX element
        - react collects the attributes and puts them in an object
        - props object shows up as the first argument to the child component function
        - we use the props however we wish
    
Event system:
    - decide on an Event to watch
    - create a function (event handler/callback function)
    - name the function usually using handle + 'Event Name';
    - pass function as prop to element
    - use valid event name
    - pass a reference to the function, do not call it

Async / Await:
    - tells JS to wait for the request to finish before moving on

Components:
    - siblings cannot communicate directly with each other
    - always have to involve the parent

Handling text inputs:
    - 1. create a new piece of state
    - 2. create an event handler to watch for onChange event
    - 3. when the onChange event fires, get the value from the input
    - 4. take that value from the input and use it to update your state
    - 5. pass your state to the input as the value prop

Promise:
    - async/await
    - need to resolve the promise after a request

Keys for lists:
    - must use a key when using a list of elements
    - add key to top most JSX element
    - must be string or number
    - should be unique for the specific list
    - should be consistent across rerenders

State with multiple level children:
    - find lowest common parent to define the state in

Using arrays in state:
    - do not modify the array by using push or other modifiers
    - do not modify specific elements using index
    - must create a new array

State Cheat Sheet:
    - https://state-updates.vercel.app/

useEffect feature:
    - import from react
    - used to run code when a component is initially rendered and sometimes when rerendered
    - always called on the first render of component
    - may be called on further state changes depending on func passed in
    - can't return numbers or strings
    - can't use async/await (useEffect automatically returns a promise)
    - you can return a function!
    - examples:
        1. pass in [] as second argument, only run after first render
        2. pass in ''(nothing) as second argument, runs on all rerenders
        3. pass in [variable], called after rerenders if variable is changed

Context feature:
    - alternative to props
    - can share context through components
    - not a replacement for props
    - not a replacement for redux
    - context object:
        - provider: use to specify what data to share
        - consumer: not used often
    - Using context:
        1. create the context
        2. specify data that will be shared
        3. consume the data in a components
        4. usually wraps the app component

useCallback:
    - hook to help tell react that a fucntion isnt actually changing over time
    - fixes bugs around useEffect and other similar situations
    - follows similar conventions as useEffect (second argument is an array)
    - examples:
        1. pass in [] as second argument, useCallback returns the function/data from the very first render
        2. pass in [variable], useCallbakc retunrs the new function/data after rerender

prop-types:
    - JS library used to validate props that get passed into component
    - if incorrent value passed in, a warning will appear in console
    - used to be very popular. Typescript does almost the same thing and more

conditional rendering:
    - react doesn't print booleans,nulls or undefined

useRef:
    - allows a component to get a reference to a DOM element that it creates

Custom Hooks:
    - contain reusable logic
    - usually reuse built-on hooks like useState
    - usually easiest way to extract logic into a hook, rather than making a hook first
    
Good method to create custom hooks:
    - find code in a component related to a single piece of state
    - copy paste it all into a helper function
    - fix all the broken references
    - Ta-da, you now have a hook

useReducer:
    - hook for managing state
    - similar to using redux
    - whatever you return from reducer will be the new state
    - if nothing is returned then the state will be undefined!
